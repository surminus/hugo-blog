title: "One Year of Working Solo"

Ever since starting my career path in technology, I've always been part of a
team.  Last year I accepted a role where I would be "working solo", and this
was a big reason in my decision to accept. I was interested in the challenges
and difference of experience, and as I come up to my one year anniversary, I
thought it would be a useful time to reflect.

I am the "sole" Site Reliability Engineer (read: Operations Engineer), and set
my own goals, perform my own planning, and look back on my own achievements.

I have support from Senior Techs around me, but ultimately I am on my own.

## What I've Enjoyed

### Autonomy

Summary: you set your own work, and you do it the way you think is best

Having this amount of autonomy requires a great deal of trust from the business
in me, and I feel I have always had this.

It is wonderfully liberating to feel you are in charge of your own destiny,
but I make sure I check back with the Senior Techs to ensure that what I'm
doing makes sense.

### Pace

Summary: choose how long you spend working on the thing

Whether you want to spend a long time investigating options, or spend a short time
shipping as much stuff as possible, being able to set your own pace is similar to
autonomy. It requires trust, but you are able to prioritise things as you
think they should be prioritised.

### Lack of meetings

Summary: meetings are few and far between

Without doing planning, retrospectives and team health meetings on a regular basis,
I have got used to not going to meetings.

I specifically do one meeting a week to meet with the Senior Techs, and even this
is pretty informal.

I find meetings difficult because I have an extremely low concentration span, and
so have on the whole enjoyed a life without them.

## What I've Disliked

### The unknown future is scary

### No planning and retros

### Having a team to fall back on

### No-one to celebrate with
